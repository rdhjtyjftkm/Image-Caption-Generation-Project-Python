Image Caption Generation Using Python and AI
Project Overview
This project focuses on generating image captions using a pre-trained AI model. The model leverages TensorFlow and the Hugging Face framework to process images and produce descriptive captions automatically.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for building the solution.
NumPy: For numerical computing and array manipulation.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: Used for plotting and visualizing images.
TensorFlow: For building and running deep learning models.
Hugging Face Model: Pre-trained model used for caption generation.
Key Features
Automatic caption generation for images.
Achieved benchmark-level results in caption accuracy.
Supports a variety of image formats for caption generation.
Implemented a user-friendly interface to input images and generate captions.
Installation & Setup
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-caption-generation.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd image-caption-generation
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python generate_captions.py
Usage
Add your images to the input_images folder.
Run the script, and captions will be generated and saved in the output folder.
Use matplotlib to visualize images with their generated captions.
Example
Below is an example of a generated caption:


Caption: "A group of people standing on a mountain top during sunset."

Future Enhancements
Improve caption accuracy by fine-tuning the model with a larger dataset.
Add support for generating captions in multiple languages.
Implement a web interface for easier interaction.
